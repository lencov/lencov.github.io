The Tech Minds Meetup was an event hosted by UH to give students the opportunity to network with professionals in the tech industry. They organized it in rounds where students sat a professionals table for the duration of the round and talked with them. I spoke to 5 different professionals at the event.

The first one I talked to is a software engineer at a non-profit. He was a 2023 graduate from UHM. He told us that he actually got the job because of his project from ICS 314. He built some product for them and then hired him as an intern during his senior year and then hired him full time once he graduated.

The second one is a senior staff engineer at Meta. He works on Reality Labs and his team handles release infrastructure. Prior to his time at Meta, he worked for many startups with Oculus being the last before they were acquired by Meta. With my upcoming internship at Meta, I asked him about any advice he had for when I get there. He told me to not to get to caught up in having fun with all the other interns and all the events Meta hosts and that it is a time to work hard to secure a return offer.

The third and fourth people I spoke to was the founder of GOALL, a company we invested in at the student venture fund, and a manager from a construction company. It was good to catch up with the GOALL founder and here about the progress they are having. With the manager from the construction company, he told me about how they were trying to integrate more technology into the business and they are having a hard time with finding suitable people for this as they have traditionally only hired from the engineering college.

The last person I talked to at the event is the co-founder of a startup called Risotto. I had looked through the list of professionals prior to the event and remembered that he participated in Y Combinator and I asked him about the experience. He had high praise for the program and feels that it has been a great help in his company's success. We ended up talking more about his company and startups in general.

Overall, I had a good time at the event. I learned a lot and made great new connections.
