Reflection on My Use of AI in ICS 314

I. Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become increasingly important in education, particularly in software engineering due to the rapid changes and constant innovation in the field. Throughout ICS 314, I frequently used AI tools such as ChatGPT (GPT-4o), Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Cursor. I switched between these models as each company released improved versions.

II. Personal Experience with AI

Experience WODs

I consistently used AI for Experience WODs such as E18 since I already knew most of the content from previous software engineering internships. These WODs were straightforward and required minimal prompting.

In-class Practice WODs

AI was useful for practice WODs because they were timed, and using AI helped me complete them faster. Clear prompts typically resulted in correct solutions quickly.

In-class WODs

For graded, timed WODs, AI helped improve my efficiency. Using precise prompts allowed me to quickly obtain correct and concise code implementations, reducing trial and error.

Essays

For essays, I gave ChatGPT the essay prompt along with my informal, unstructured thoughts on the topic, then asked it to organize and refine my ideas into a professional essay.

Final Project

I used AI extensively during our final project, primarily Cursor with Claude and Gemini. I created a detailed design document for our database, APIs, and other features. This document was useful for providing AI context when generating code. Occasionally, AI did not follow the guidelines I set, causing frustration and requiring manual corrections. A notable issue was team members overly relying on AI without proper guidance, leading to integration problems.

Learning a Concept / Tutorial

AI was very helpful for learning new concepts, especially for frontend topics like React, where my understanding was initially limited.

Answering a Question in Class or Discord

AI allowed me to quickly provide accurate answers to classmates' questions, facilitating effective discussions.

Asking or Answering a Smart Question

AI helped me phrase clear and concise questions, improving communication and problem-solving.

Coding Examples

AI provided helpful coding examples, making it easier to understand new concepts quickly.

Explaining Code

AI was effective in breaking down and clearly explaining complex code, aiding in debugging and comprehension.

Writing Code

AI generally produced good-quality code when prompted clearly, significantly speeding up my implementation process.

Documenting Code

AI improved the quality and clarity of documentation, maintaining consistency throughout my codebase.

Quality Assurance

AI was helpful for initial debugging but struggled with fixing ESLint errors. Manual intervention, such as using lint:fix followed by manual corrections, was usually quicker.

Other Uses

AI was beneficial for code reviews and optimization tasks during team projects, improving overall efficiency.

III. Impact on Learning and Understanding

Using AI significantly affected my learning, especially in frontend development, where my initial understanding of React was shallow. Although AI sped up learning and development, it sometimes resulted in superficial knowledge, particularly regarding deeper concepts like state management, caching, and optimization. This experience highlighted the importance of foundational knowledge alongside using AI.

IV. Practical Applications

Outside ICS 314, AI has been similarly beneficial in my professional workflow. Creating detailed design documents for AI context and generating code snippets has sped up development significantly. AI has also been valuable for rapid prototyping in entrepreneurial projects, although scalability is limited as the project complexity grows.

V. Challenges and Opportunities

Despite benefits, a key challenge is over-reliance on AI by engineers who lack foundational knowledge, leading to poor design choices and difficult debugging. However, AI integration presents opportunities to improve software engineering education by balancing foundational skill mastery with AI-assisted learning.

VI. Comparative Analysis

AI-enhanced education has advantages, particularly for motivated learners interested in deeper understanding. However, traditional methods remain important for verifying fundamental skills. Ideally, education should combine AI-assisted learning for rapid concept grasp with traditional assessments to ensure proper skill retention.

VII. Future Considerations

Future AI integration in software engineering education should be balanced carefully. Fundamental courses (ICS 111, 211, 212, 311) should limit AI use in assessments to ensure foundational skills are learned. More advanced courses like ICS 314 can incorporate AI if foundational knowledge is verified. AI should primarily act as a learning aid rather than a replacement for genuine problem-solving skills.

VIII. Conclusion

Overall, AI significantly improved my learning efficiency and practical skills in ICS 314. However, careful use is essential to avoid over-reliance and maintain independent problem-solving skills. Future courses should strategically balance AI use with traditional skill assessments for optimal educational outcomes.
