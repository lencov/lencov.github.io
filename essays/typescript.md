What do you think about Typescript so far?
I’ve been using TypeScript at work for nearly a year now, and I’ve grown pretty comfortable with it. Compared to JavaScript, I’ve found TypeScript much better for writing structured and maintainable code. Its static typing helps catch errors early and makes the code easier to work with, especially in larger projects. This has made collaboration with teammates more efficient, as the type definitions act like a shared contract everyone can follow.

If you have prior experience, did you learn new things from this module?
I didn’t learn too much that was new, but it did introduce me to some features I wasn’t aware of, like utility types and other advanced capabilities.

Overall, I think TypeScript is a great programming language, especially for app and web development. It keeps the flexibility of JavaScript while adding tools that make projects easier to scale and maintain. In my experience, it’s been a solid choice for building better software.
