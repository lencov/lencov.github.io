## Is There Such a Thing as a Stupid Question?

We’ve all heard the adage, “There’s no such thing as a stupid question.” Yet, anyone who’s spent time in technical communities knows this isn’t entirely true. Poorly framed questions waste time, frustrate responders, and often go unanswered. Eric Raymond’s *How to Ask Questions the Smart Way* argues that the difference between a “smart” and “not smart” question isn’t just semantics—it’s the difference between sparking collaboration and being met with silence (or worse, sarcasm). Let’s dissect two Stack Overflow examples to see why.

## Anatomy of a Smart Question

### "Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?"  
**Link:** [Stack Overflow Question #11227809](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array)  

#### The Question  
A developer noticed a 5x performance difference in C++ when iterating sorted vs. unsorted arrays. They included:  
- A **minimal code example** with benchmarking.  
- Details about their compiler and optimization flags.  
- Their discovery that disassembling the code revealed branch prediction behavior.  

#### Why It’s Smart  
1. **Specificity:** The title directly states the problem. No fluff.  
2. **Demonstrated Effort:** They ruled out compiler quirks and tested hypotheses.  
3. **Reproducibility:** Code snippets and environment details let others replicate the issue.  

#### The Response  
The top answer (4,600+ upvotes) explained CPU branch prediction with an analogy about train switches and provided assembly-level analysis. The thread became a canonical reference, illustrating how a well-posed question elevates collective knowledge.
